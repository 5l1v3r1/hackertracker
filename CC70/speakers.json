He feeds complete garbage to forensic tools, AV products, decompression software, and intrusion detection systems. He made evil strings more evil (with automation) to exploit high consumption regular expressions. Lately he has been declaring war on assembly language (calling it too high-level) and doing all kinds of ignorant things with machine code. More information can be found on xlogicx.net.",
